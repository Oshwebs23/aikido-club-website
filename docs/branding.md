Branding Update:

🎯 Reasons for the Branding Change
- The previous branding was closely tied to the university, which limited wider appeal.
- The club aims to attract non‑students and broaden its client base.
- A more modern visual identity was needed, with an emphasis on Swansea Bay and subtle Japanese‑inspired aesthetics that reflect Aikido’s heritage.

📌 Current Status
- A new branding package has been designed and approved.
- The updated branding has been implemented on the website.

🚀 Next Steps
- Update all social media platforms to reflect the new branding.
- Ensure consistency across profile images, banners, and post templates.
- Review printed materials (if any) for future alignment.
