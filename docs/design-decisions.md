## Logo Placement (Left-Aligned in Header)

The club logo is positioned on the left side of the header to create a strong visual anchor and support natural reading flow. Placing the logo at the left establishes brand identity immediately and improves navigation clarity. This placement also aligns with common martial arts club websites, reinforcing familiarity and trust.

## Hero Section Strategy (Intro Message Followed by “About Us”)

The home page places the introductory message at the top, immediately followed by the “About Us” section. This structure is designed to build trust quickly by giving new visitors context about the club before asking them to take action. Positioning “About Us” early encourages users to scroll and engage, increasing the likelihood they will click the call‑to‑action button and explore further.

## Call-to-Action Placement (Encouraging User Flow)

The primary call‑to‑action button is placed directly beneath the introductory content to guide visitors toward the next logical step. This reduces friction, supports a clear user journey, and helps convert casual visitors into potential students.

### Centered Page Titles 
Updated the global Pages template in the WordPress Site Editor to center all dynamic page titles.  
This improves visual hierarchy, creates a more balanced layout, and aligns with the overall design direction of the site.  
The change applies to all standard pages using the default Pages template.
